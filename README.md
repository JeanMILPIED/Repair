# Repair
## repair note books
## some personal work towards predicting the reparability of an object using 2 databases
- repair cafe : uses database from repair café (updated Sept2019, not public but shared by email)
- OPen repair: uses the consolidated database available at the following link(https://therestartproject.org/download-dataset/)

## this work compiles the following steps
- statistical exploration of the dataset
- cleaning of the dataset
- proposal for a prediction ML algorithm for "can be repaired or not?"
- prediction interface that uses the database and the ML trained algo

## most advanced work is made for repair Café database
## next steps would be:
- merge of the 2 datasets to increase observations >30000
- merge the ML training algo
- publication of a prediction API
